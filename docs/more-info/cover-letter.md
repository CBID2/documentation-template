# Cover Letter

When I learned about the Hyperledger Mentorship Program through a colleague's post on Twitter, I went to your website to learn more about it. My interest in applying to your program increased after reading about Calipher's documentation update project.  I'm particularly interested in learning about effective documentation techniques and Blockchain and believe this project would be a valuable learning experience.

In my 3+ years crafting personalized writing lessons for college students at Pearson and delivering engaging coding tutorials as a Technical Writer at FreeCodeCamp, I've honed the art of transforming complex material into digestible content.  As an avid open source contributor at OpenSauced, I collaborated closely with the documentation team to produce a range of material, such as comprehensive user guides, blog posts, and bite-sized tutorials. Witnessing a 50% surge in user engagement following the publication of these resources not only validates my approach but also reinforces my passion for making technical content understandable and approachable for all.

My proficiency in GitHub and Google Docs, coupled with my familiarity with languages like Markdown, HTML, and CSS, and tools such as Adobe Acrobat and Docusaurus enables me to craft interactive and visually appealing content that resonates with diverse audiences. Moreover, my attention to detail and strong organizational skills ensure that projects are delivered promptly without compromising their quality.

As someone who wants to pursue a career in technical writing, I hope to not only expand my skillset in creating user-friendly documentation but also contribute to the ongoing success of the Calipher project and the Hyperledger community. I am eager to further discuss how my experiences and skills can aid Hyperledger in improving Calipher's documentation.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,

Christine Belzie
